## Overview

LLM as Judge evaluates your agent workflows using AI to analyze performance across three dimensions: **context flow**, **memory utilization**, and **knowledge retrieval**.

## Evaluation Modes

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Context Mode" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Evaluates how context flows between agents in multi-agent workflows
  </Card>
  <Card title="Memory Mode" icon="brain">
    Evaluates how agents store and retrieve memories effectively
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge Mode" icon="book">
    Evaluates how agents search and use knowledge bases
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Run with Trace">
    ```bash
    praisonai recipe run my-recipe --save --name my-trace
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Judge the Trace">
    ```bash
    # Context evaluation (default)
    praisonai recipe judge my-trace --yaml agents.yaml

    # Memory evaluation
    praisonai recipe judge my-trace --memory

    # Knowledge evaluation
    praisonai recipe judge my-trace --knowledge
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Improvements">
    ```bash
    praisonai recipe apply judge_plan.yaml --confirm
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Context Evaluation Criteria

The default **context mode** evaluates each agent on **6 criteria**:

| Criterion | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Task Achievement** | 1-10 | Did the agent accomplish its goal? |
| **Context Utilization** | 1-10 | Was the context effectively used? |
| **Output Quality** | 1-10 | Is the output high quality and relevant? |
| **Instruction Following** | 1-10 | Did the agent follow specific instructions? |
| **Hallucination** | 1-10 | 10=no fabrication, 1=severe hallucination |
| **Error Handling** | 1-10 | How well did the agent handle errors? |

## Memory Evaluation Criteria

The **memory mode** (`--memory`) evaluates how agents use memory:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Memory Operations
        S[🧠 Store] --> DB[(Memory DB)]
        DB --> R[🔍 Search]
    end
    
    subgraph Evaluation
        R --> E1[Retrieval Relevance]
        S --> E2[Storage Quality]
        R --> E3[Recall Effectiveness]
        S --> E4[Memory Efficiency]
    end
    
    style S fill:#4CAF50,color:#fff
    style R fill:#2196F3,color:#fff
```

| Criterion | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Retrieval Relevance** | 1-10 | Did the agent search for relevant memories? |
| **Storage Quality** | 1-10 | Did the agent store useful information? |
| **Recall Effectiveness** | 1-10 | Was retrieved memory used in the response? |
| **Memory Efficiency** | 1-10 | No redundant stores/searches? |

## Knowledge Evaluation Criteria

The **knowledge mode** (`--knowledge`) evaluates RAG and knowledge retrieval:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph Knowledge Operations
        Q[❓ Query] --> K[(Knowledge Base)]
        K --> D[📄 Documents]
    end
    
    subgraph Evaluation
        Q --> E1[Retrieval Accuracy]
        D --> E2[Source Coverage]
        D --> E3[Citation Quality]
        D --> E4[Knowledge Integration]
    end
    
    style Q fill:#9C27B0,color:#fff
    style D fill:#FF9800,color:#fff
```

| Criterion | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Retrieval Accuracy** | 1-10 | Did the agent find relevant documents? |
| **Source Coverage** | 1-10 | Were all relevant sources used? |
| **Citation Quality** | 1-10 | Were sources properly attributed? |
| **Knowledge Integration** | 1-10 | Was knowledge well-integrated? |

## Tool Evaluation

Each tool call is evaluated for:

- **Input Quality** - Was the input well-formed?
- **Output Utilization** - Was the output fully used?
- **Result Completeness** - Was the full result captured?
- **Error Detection** - Were there any errors?

```
Tool Calls (2):
  - tavily_search: completeness=9.0/10
  - create_wp_post: completeness=8.0/10
    Issues: unexpected keyword argument
```

## Context Flow Analysis

The judge tracks how context flows between agents:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Agent 1] -->|"Output: keywords"| B[Agent 2]
    B -->|"Output: topics"| C[Agent 3]
    
    style A fill:#90EE90
    style B fill:#90EE90
    style C fill:#90EE90
```

**Scores:**
- `10/10 ✓` - Full context passed
- `5-9/10` - Partial context
- `<5/10 ⚠️` - Content loss detected

## Content Loss Detection

The judge detects when important content is lost:

```
⚠️  CONTENT LOSS DETECTED:
  - Tool 'tavily_search' result was truncated
  - LLM response was truncated for agent 'Writer'
```

## Fix Types

The judge generates different fix types:

| Fix Type | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `append_instruction` | Add guidance to existing instructions |
| `add_expected_output` | Specify expected output format |
| `modify_context_config` | Adjust context settings |
| `suggestion` | General improvement suggestion |

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Run Multiple Times" icon="repeat">
    Judge the same trace multiple times to get consistent scores
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use YAML Context" icon="file-code">
    Always provide `--yaml` for context-aware evaluation
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review Before Apply" icon="eye">
    Use `--dry-run` to preview changes before applying
  </Card>
  <Card title="Backup Your Files" icon="copy">
    The apply command creates backups by default
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Integration with Recipes

```bash
# Full workflow: run → judge → apply
praisonai recipe run my-recipe --save --name test-run
praisonai recipe judge test-run --yaml agents.yaml --output plan.yaml
praisonai recipe apply plan.yaml --dry-run
praisonai recipe apply plan.yaml --confirm
```

## Programmatic Usage

<CodeGroup>
```python Context Mode
from praisonai.replay import ContextTraceReader, ContextEffectivenessJudge
from praisonai.replay.judge import format_judge_report

# Load trace
reader = ContextTraceReader()
events = reader.read_trace("my-trace")

# Judge with context mode (default)
judge = ContextEffectivenessJudge(mode="context")
report = judge.judge_trace(events, session_id="my-trace")
print(format_judge_report(report))
```

```python Memory Mode
from praisonai.replay import ContextTraceReader, ContextEffectivenessJudge

# Load trace
reader = ContextTraceReader()
events = reader.read_trace("my-trace")

# Judge with memory mode
judge = ContextEffectivenessJudge(mode="memory")
report = judge.judge_trace(events, session_id="my-trace")
print(f"Memory Score: {report.overall_score}/10")
```

```python Knowledge Mode
from praisonai.replay import ContextTraceReader, ContextEffectivenessJudge

# Load trace
reader = ContextTraceReader()
events = reader.read_trace("my-trace")

# Judge with knowledge mode
judge = ContextEffectivenessJudge(mode="knowledge")
report = judge.judge_trace(events, session_id="my-trace")
print(f"Knowledge Score: {report.overall_score}/10")
```
