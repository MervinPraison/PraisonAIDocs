# AgentsGenerator.load_tools_from_package

*Class: [AgentsGenerator](../classes/AgentsGenerator)*

Loads tools from a specified package path containing modules with functions or classes.

Parameters:
    package_path (str): The path to the package containing the tools.

Returns:
    dict: A dictionary containing the names of the tools as keys and the corresponding initialized instances of the classes as values.

Raises:
    FileNotFoundError: If the specified package path does not exist.

This function iterates through all the .py files in the specified package path, excluding those that start with "__". For each file, it imports the corresponding module and checks if it contains any functions or classes that can be loaded as tools. The function then returns a dictionary containing the names of the tools as keys and the corresponding initialized instances of the classes as values.
