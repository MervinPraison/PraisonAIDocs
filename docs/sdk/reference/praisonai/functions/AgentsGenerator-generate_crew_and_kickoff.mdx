# AgentsGenerator.generate_crew_and_kickoff

*Class: [AgentsGenerator](../classes/AgentsGenerator)*

Generates a crew of agents and initiates tasks based on the provided configuration.

Parameters:
    agent_file (str): The path to the agent file.
    framework (str): The framework to be used for the agents.
    config_list (list): A list of configurations for the agents.

Returns:
    str: The output of the tasks performed by the crew of agents.

Raises:
    FileNotFoundError: If the specified agent file does not exist.

This function first loads the agent configuration from the specified file. It then initializes the tools required for the agents based on the specified framework. If the specified framework is "autogen", it loads the LLM configuration dynamically and creates an AssistantAgent for each role in the configuration. It then adds tools to the agents if specified in the configuration. Finally, it prepares tasks for the agents based on the configuration and initiates the tasks using the crew of agents. If the specified framework is not "autogen", it creates a crew of agents and initiates tasks based on the configuration.
