Unified Endpoints Module

Provides unified discovery, provider adapters, and server utilities
for all PraisonAI serve features.

Provider Types:
- recipe: Recipe runner endpoints
- agents-api: Single/multi-agent HTTP API
- mcp: MCP server (stdio, http, sse)
- tools-mcp: Tools exposed as MCP server
- a2a: Agent-to-agent protocol
- a2u: Agent-to-user event stream

Architecture:
- Discovery schema is versioned and consistent across all providers
- Provider adapters abstract protocol differences
- CLI client uses unified discovery for list/describe/invoke/health

## Overview
This module provides components for endpoints.
