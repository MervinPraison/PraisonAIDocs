PraisonAI Code - AI-powered code editing tools.

This module provides tools for AI agents to read, write, and modify code files
with precision using search/replace diff strategies similar to Kilo Code.

Features:
- read_file: Read file contents with optional line ranges
- write_file: Create or overwrite files
- list_files: List directory contents with filtering
- apply_diff: Apply SEARCH/REPLACE diffs with fuzzy matching
- search_replace: Multiple search/replace operations
- execute_command: Run shell commands safely

Example:
    from praisonai.code import read_file, write_file, apply_diff
    
    # Read a file
    content = read_file("path/to/file.py")
    
    # Write a file
    write_file("path/to/new_file.py", "print('hello')")
    
    # Apply a diff
    result = apply_diff("path/to/file.py", diff_content)

## Overview
This module provides components for code.
