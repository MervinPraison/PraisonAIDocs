# escalation

<Badge color="blue">Core SDK</Badge>

Escalation Module for PraisonAI Agents.

Provides progressive escalation pipeline for auto-mode execution:
- Stage 0: Direct response (no tools, no planning)
- Stage 1: Heuristic tool usage (local signals, no extra LLM call)
- Stage 2: Lightweight plan (single LLM call, constrained)
- Stage 3: Full autonomous loop (tools + subagents + verification)

Zero Performance Impact:
- All imports are lazy loaded via __getattr__
- Escalation only triggered when signals indicate need
- No overhead for simple tasks

Usage:
    from praisonaiagents.escalation import EscalationPipeline, EscalationStage
    
    pipeline = EscalationPipeline()
    stage = pipeline.analyze(prompt, context)
    result = await pipeline.execute(prompt, stage)

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import escalation
```
