Hooks Module for PraisonAI Agents.

Provides a powerful hook system for intercepting and modifying agent behavior
at various lifecycle points. Unlike callbacks (which are for UI events),
hooks can intercept, modify, or block tool execution.

Features:
- Event-based hook system (BeforeTool, AfterTool, BeforeAgent, etc.)
- Shell command hooks for external integrations
- Python function hooks for in-process customization
- Matcher patterns for selective hook execution
- Sequential and parallel hook execution
- Decision outcomes (allow, deny, block, ask)

Zero Performance Impact:
- All imports are lazy loaded via centralized _lazy.py utility
- Hooks only execute when registered
- No overhead when hooks are disabled

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import hooks
```

## Constants

| Name | Value |
