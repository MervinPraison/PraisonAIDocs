Agent Skills module for PraisonAI Agents.

This module provides support for the open Agent Skills standard (agentskills.io),
enabling agents to load and use modular capabilities through SKILL.md files.

Zero Performance Impact:
- All imports are lazy loaded via __getattr__
- Skills only loaded when explicitly enabled
- No auto-discovery at import time

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import skills
```
