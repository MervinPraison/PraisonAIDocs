PraisonAI Streaming Module.

Provides the StreamEvent protocol for pass-through streaming from LLM providers.

This module is lazily loaded to ensure zero performance impact when streaming
features are not used.

Usage:
    from praisonaiagents.streaming import (
        StreamEvent,
        StreamEventType,
        StreamMetrics,
        StreamEventEmitter,
        create_text_printer_callback,
    )

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import streaming
```
