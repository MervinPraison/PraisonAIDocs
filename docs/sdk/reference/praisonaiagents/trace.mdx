<Badge color="blue">Core SDK</Badge>

Trace Module for PraisonAI Agents.

Provides lightweight action tracing for the `output="actions"` mode.
Shows agent lifecycle events, tool calls, and final output without
verbose internal details.

Zero Performance Impact:
- All imports are lazy loaded via __getattr__
- NoOpSink is the default (zero overhead when not used)
- Disabled emitter has near-zero overhead

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import trace
```
