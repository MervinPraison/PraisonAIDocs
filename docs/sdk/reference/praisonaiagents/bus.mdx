Event Bus Module for PraisonAI Agents.

Provides a typed publish/subscribe event system for real-time communication
between components. Extends the existing hooks system with a more general
event-driven architecture.

Features:
- Typed event definitions with dataclass payloads
- Sync and async subscribers
- Event filtering by type
- Global and scoped event buses
- SSE-compatible event streaming

Zero Performance Impact:
- All imports are lazy loaded
- No overhead when not subscribed
- Optional dependency for server features

Usage:
    from praisonaiagents.bus import EventBus, Event
    
    # Create event bus
    bus = EventBus()
    
    # Subscribe to events
    @bus.on("session.created")
    def handle_session(event):
        print(f"Session created: &#123;event.data&#125;")
    
    # Publish events
    bus.publish("session.created", &#123;"session_id": "abc123"&#125;)

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import bus
```
