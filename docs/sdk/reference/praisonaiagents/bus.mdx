Event Bus Module for PraisonAI Agents.

Provides a typed publish/subscribe event system for real-time communication
between components. Extends the existing hooks system with a more general
event-driven architecture.

Features:
- Typed event definitions with dataclass payloads
- Sync and async subscribers
- Event filtering by type
- Global and scoped event buses
- SSE-compatible event streaming

Zero Performance Impact:
- All imports are lazy loaded
- No overhead when not subscribed
- Optional dependency for server features

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import bus
```
