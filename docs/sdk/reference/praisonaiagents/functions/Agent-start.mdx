# Agent.start

*Class: [Agent](../classes/Agent)*

Start the agent interactively with verbose output.

Beginner-friendly execution. Defaults to verbose output with streaming
when running in a TTY. Use this for interactive/terminal usage where 
you want to see output in real-time with rich formatting.

Args:
    prompt: The input prompt to process. If not provided, uses the 
            agent's instructions as the task (useful when instructions
            already describe what the agent should do).
    **kwargs: Additional arguments:
        - stream (bool | None): Override streaming. None = auto-detect TTY
        - output (str): Output preset override (e.g., "silent", "verbose")
        
Returns:
    - If streaming: Generator yielding response chunks
    - If not streaming: The complete response as a string
    
Example:
    ```python
    # Minimal usage - instructions IS the task
    agent = Agent(instructions="Research AI trends and summarize")
    result = agent.start()  # Uses instructions as task
    
    # With explicit prompt (overrides/adds to instructions)
    agent = Agent(instructions="You are a helpful assistant")
    result = agent.start("What is 2+2?")  # Uses prompt as task
    ```
    
Note:
    Unlike .run() which is always silent (production use), .start()
    enables verbose output by default when in a TTY for beginner-friendly
    interactive use. Use .run() for programmatic/scripted usage.

## Signature
