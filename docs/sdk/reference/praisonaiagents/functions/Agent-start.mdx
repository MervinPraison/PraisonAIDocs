> This is a method of the [**Agent**](../classes/Agent) class in the [**agent**](../modules/agent) module.

Start the agent interactively with verbose output.

Beginner-friendly execution. Defaults to verbose output with streaming
when running in a TTY. Use this for interactive/terminal usage where 
you want to see output in real-time with rich formatting.

## Signature

```python
def start(prompt: str) -> Any
```

## Parameters

<ParamField query="prompt" type="str" required={false}>
  The input prompt to process. If not provided, uses the  agent's instructions as the task (useful when instructions already describe what the agent should do). **kwargs: Additional arguments: - stream (bool | None): Override streaming. None = auto-detect TTY - output (str): Output preset override (e.g., "silent", "verbose")
</ParamField>

### Returns

<ResponseField name="Returns" type="Any">
  Generator yielding response chunks
    - If not streaming: The complete response as a string
</ResponseField>

## Usage

```python
```python
    # Minimal usage - instructions IS the task
    agent = Agent(instructions="Research AI trends and summarize")
    result = agent.start()  # Uses instructions as task
    
    # With explicit prompt (overrides/adds to instructions)
    agent = Agent(instructions="You are a helpful assistant")
    result = agent.start("What is 2+2?")  # Uses prompt as task
    ```
    
Note:
    Unlike .run() which is always silent (production use), .start()
    enables verbose output by default when in a TTY for beginner-friendly
    interactive use. Use .run() for programmatic/scripted usage.
```
