> This is a method of the [**Memory**](../classes/Memory) class in the [**memory**](../modules/memory) module.

Delete a specific memory by ID.

This is the unified deletion method that searches across all memory types
and all backends (SQLite, ChromaDB, Mem0, MongoDB).

Particularly useful for:
- Cleaning up image-based memories after processing to free context window
- Removing outdated or incorrect information
- Privacy compliance (selective erasure)

## Signature

```python
def delete_memory(memory_id: str, memory_type: Optional[str]) -> bool
```

## Parameters

<ParamField query="memory_id" type="str" required={true}>
  The unique ID of the memory to delete
</ParamField>

<ParamField query="memory_type" type="Optional" required={false}>
  Optional type hint to narrow search: 'short_term', 'long_term' If None, searches all types.
</ParamField>

### Returns

<ResponseField name="Returns" type="bool">
  True if memory was found and deleted, False otherwise
</ResponseField>

## Usage

```python
# Delete a specific image analysis memory
    memory.delete_memory("1705123456789")

    # Delete with type hint for faster lookup
    memory.delete_memory("1705123456789", memory_type="short_term")
```
