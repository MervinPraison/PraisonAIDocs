# Memory.delete_memory

*Class: [Memory](../classes/Memory)*

Delete a specific memory by ID.

This is the unified deletion method that searches across all memory types
and all backends (SQLite, ChromaDB, Mem0, MongoDB).

Particularly useful for:
- Cleaning up image-based memories after processing to free context window
- Removing outdated or incorrect information
- Privacy compliance (selective erasure)

Args:
    memory_id: The unique ID of the memory to delete
    memory_type: Optional type hint to narrow search:
                'short_term', 'long_term'
                If None, searches all types.
    
Returns:
    True if memory was found and deleted, False otherwise

Example:
    # Delete a specific image analysis memory
    memory.delete_memory("1705123456789")
    
    # Delete with type hint for faster lookup
    memory.delete_memory("1705123456789", memory_type="short_term")

## Signature

def delete_memory(memory_id: str, memory_type: Optional[str]) -> bool
```
