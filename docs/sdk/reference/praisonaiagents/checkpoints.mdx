Checkpoints Module for PraisonAI Agents.

Provides file-level checkpointing using a shadow git repository to track
and restore file changes made by agents. This enables:

- Automatic checkpointing before file modifications
- Rewind to any previous checkpoint
- Diff between checkpoints
- Restore files and conversation state together

Zero Performance Impact:
- All imports are lazy loaded via __getattr__
- Checkpoints only created when enabled
- No overhead when checkpoints are disabled

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import checkpoints
```
