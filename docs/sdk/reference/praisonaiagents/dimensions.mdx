Embedding dimension utilities.

This module provides utilities for determining embedding dimensions
based on model names. Consolidates the dimension lookup logic that
was previously duplicated in memory.py and knowledge.py.

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import dimensions
```

## Functions

### get_dimensions()

Get embedding dimensions based on model name.

This function checks if the model name contains any known model
identifiers and returns the corresponding dimension. Falls back
to the default dimension (1536) for unknown models.

Args:
    model_name: The embedding model name (e.g., "text-embedding-3-small")

Returns:
    The embedding dimension for the model

Example:
    >>> get_dimensions("text-embedding-3-small")
    1536
    >>> get_dimensions("openai/text-embedding-3-large")
    3072
    >>> get_dimensions("unknown-model")
    1536

```python
def get_dimensions(model_name: str) -> int
```
