Embedding dimension utilities.

This module provides utilities for determining embedding dimensions
based on model names. Consolidates the dimension lookup logic that
was previously duplicated in memory.py and knowledge.py.

## Overview
This module provides components for dimensions.

## Functions

**[Dedicated Page: get_dimensions()](../functions/get_dimensions)**

### get_dimensions()

Get embedding dimensions based on model name.

This function checks if the model name contains any known model
identifiers and returns the corresponding dimension. Falls back
to the default dimension (1536) for unknown models.

```python
def get_dimensions(model_name: str) -> int
```

<Expandable title="Parameters">
- **model_name** (`str`)
  The embedding model name (e.g., "text-embedding-3-small")
</Expandable>


## Constants

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
| `DEFAULT_DIMENSION` | `1536` |
