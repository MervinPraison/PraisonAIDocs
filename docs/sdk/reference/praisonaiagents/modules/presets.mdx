Preset Registries for Consolidated Parameters.

Centralized preset definitions for all consolidated parameters.
These are used by the unified resolver for string preset lookups.

All presets are defined as dicts to avoid circular imports.
The resolver converts them to config instances as needed.

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents.config import presets
```

### Constants

| Name | Value |
|------|-------|
