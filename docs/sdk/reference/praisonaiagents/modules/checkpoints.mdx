Checkpoints Module for PraisonAI Agents.

Provides file-level checkpointing using a shadow git repository to track
and restore file changes made by agents. This enables:

- Automatic checkpointing before file modifications
- Rewind to any previous checkpoint
- Diff between checkpoints
- Restore files and conversation state together

Zero Performance Impact:
- All imports are lazy loaded via __getattr__
- Checkpoints only created when enabled
- No overhead when checkpoints are disabled

Usage:
    from praisonaiagents.checkpoints import CheckpointService
    
    # Create checkpoint service
    service = CheckpointService(
        workspace_dir="/path/to/project",
        storage_dir="~/.praisonai/checkpoints"
    )
    
    # Initialize shadow git
    await service.initialize()
    
    # Save a checkpoint
    checkpoint_id = await service.save("Before refactoring")
    
    # Restore to a checkpoint
    await service.restore(checkpoint_id)
    
    # Get diff between checkpoints
    diff = await service.diff(from_id, to_id)

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import checkpoints
```
