Deep Research Agent Module

This module provides the DeepResearchAgent class for automating complex research 
workflows using Deep Research APIs from multiple providers:

- **OpenAI**: o3-deep-research, o4-mini-deep-research (via Responses API)
- **Gemini**: deep-research-pro (via Interactions API)

The agent automatically detects the provider based on the model name and uses
the appropriate API.

Example:
    from praisonaiagents import DeepResearchAgent
    
    # OpenAI Deep Research
    agent = DeepResearchAgent(
        name="Research Assistant",
        model="o3-deep-research",
        instructions="You are a professional researcher..."
    )
    
    # Gemini Deep Research
    agent = DeepResearchAgent(
        name="Research Assistant", 
        model="deep-research-pro",
        instructions="You are a professional researcher..."
    )
    
    result = agent.research("What are the economic impacts of AI on healthcare?")
    print(result.report)
    for citation in result.citations:
        print(f"- &#123;citation.title&#125;: &#123;citation.url&#125;")

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents.agent import deep_research_agent
```
