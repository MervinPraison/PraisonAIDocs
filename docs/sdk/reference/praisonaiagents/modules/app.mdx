App module for production deployment of AI agents.

This module provides the protocol and configuration for AgentOS,
a production platform for deploying agents as web services.

The protocol is defined here in the core SDK (lightweight).
The implementation lives in the praisonai wrapper (heavy deps like FastAPI).

AgentOSProtocol and AgentOSConfig are the primary names (v1.0+).
AgentAppProtocol and AgentAppConfig are silent aliases for backward compatibility.

Example:
    # Protocol is importable from core SDK
    from praisonaiagents import AgentOSProtocol, AgentOSConfig
    
    # Implementation is in wrapper
    from praisonai import AgentOS
    
    app = AgentOS(
        name="My App",
        agents=[researcher, writer],
    )
    app.serve(port=8000)

## Import

```python
from praisonaiagents import app
```
