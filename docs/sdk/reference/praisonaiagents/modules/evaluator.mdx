Condition Evaluator - Shared condition evaluation logic.

This module provides the shared condition evaluation logic used by both
AgentFlow (string-based conditions) and AgentTeam (dict-based routing).

The implementation is extracted from workflows.py _evaluate_condition()
to enable DRY condition handling across the codebase.
