Verification Hooks Protocol for PraisonAI Agents.

Provides protocols for verification hooks that can be used with Agent autonomy.
Verification hooks run after file writes or at configured checkpoints to
validate agent actions (e.g., run tests, lint, build).

Usage:
    from praisonaiagents.hooks import VerificationHook, VerificationResult
    
    class TestRunner(VerificationHook):
        name = "pytest"
        
        def run(self, context=None):
            # Run tests and return result
            return VerificationResult(
                success=True,
                output="All tests passed",
                details=&#123;"tests_run": 10, "passed": 10&#125;
            )
    
    agent = Agent(
        instructions="...",
        autonomy=True,
        verification_hooks=[TestRunner()]
    )
