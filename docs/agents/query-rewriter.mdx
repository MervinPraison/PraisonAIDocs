The Query Rewriter Agent transforms user queries to improve retrieval quality in RAG applications by bridging the gap between how users ask questions and how information is stored.

## Quick Start

</CardGroup>

## Basic Rewriting

Expands abbreviations, fixes typos, and adds context to short keyword queries.

```python
from praisonaiagents import QueryRewriterAgent, RewriteStrategy

agent = QueryRewriterAgent(model="gpt-4o-mini")

# Short keyword query
result = agent.rewrite("AI trends", strategy=RewriteStrategy.BASIC)
print(result.primary_query)
# "What are the current trends in Artificial Intelligence (AI)?"

# With abbreviations
result = agent.rewrite("RAG best practices")
print(result.primary_query)
# "What are the best practices for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?"
```

## HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings)

Generates a hypothetical document that would answer the query, improving semantic matching.

```python
from praisonaiagents import QueryRewriterAgent, RewriteStrategy

agent = QueryRewriterAgent(model="gpt-4o-mini")

result = agent.rewrite("What is quantum computing?", strategy=RewriteStrategy.HYDE)

print(result.hypothetical_document)
# A detailed hypothetical answer about quantum computing
# This document is used for embedding-based retrieval
```

## Step-Back Prompting

Generates broader, higher-level questions to retrieve background context.

```python
from praisonaiagents import QueryRewriterAgent, RewriteStrategy

agent = QueryRewriterAgent(model="gpt-4o-mini")

result = agent.rewrite(
    "What is the difference between GPT-4 and Claude 3?",
    strategy=RewriteStrategy.STEP_BACK
)

print(result.primary_query)
# Rewritten specific query

print(result.step_back_question)
# "What are the key characteristics of large language models?"
```

## Sub-Query Decomposition

Breaks complex multi-part questions into focused sub-queries.

```python
from praisonaiagents import QueryRewriterAgent, RewriteStrategy

agent = QueryRewriterAgent(model="gpt-4o-mini")

result = agent.rewrite(
    "How do I set up a RAG pipeline and what embedding models should I use?",
    strategy=RewriteStrategy.SUB_QUERIES
)

for i, query in enumerate(result.sub_queries, 1):
    print(f"{i}. {query}")
# 1. How do I set up a RAG pipeline?
# 2. What are the best embedding models for RAG?
```

## Multi-Query Generation

Generates multiple paraphrased versions for ensemble retrieval.

```python
from praisonaiagents import QueryRewriterAgent, RewriteStrategy

agent = QueryRewriterAgent(model="gpt-4o-mini")

result = agent.rewrite(
    "How to improve LLM response quality?",
    strategy=RewriteStrategy.MULTI_QUERY,
    num_queries=3
)

for query in result.rewritten_queries:
    print(query)
# Multiple paraphrased versions of the query
```

## Contextual Rewriting

Uses conversation history to resolve pronouns and references.

```python
from praisonaiagents import QueryRewriterAgent, RewriteStrategy

agent = QueryRewriterAgent(model="gpt-4o-mini")

chat_history = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Tell me about Python"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Python is a programming language..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What frameworks are popular?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Django, FastAPI, PyTorch..."}
]

result = agent.rewrite(
    "What about its performance?",
    strategy=RewriteStrategy.CONTEXTUAL,
    chat_history=chat_history
)

print(result.primary_query)
# "How does Python's performance compare to other programming languages?"
```

## Auto Strategy Detection

Automatically selects the best strategy based on query characteristics.

```python
from praisonaiagents import QueryRewriterAgent, RewriteStrategy

agent = QueryRewriterAgent(model="gpt-4o-mini")

# Short query → BASIC
result = agent.rewrite("ML", strategy=RewriteStrategy.AUTO)
print(f"Strategy: {result.strategy_used.value}")  # basic

# Follow-up with history → CONTEXTUAL
result = agent.rewrite(
    "What about the cost?",
    strategy=RewriteStrategy.AUTO,
    chat_history=[...]
)
print(f"Strategy: {result.strategy_used.value}")  # contextual

# Complex query → SUB_QUERIES
result = agent.rewrite(
    "Compare transformers vs RNNs and explain use cases",
    strategy=RewriteStrategy.AUTO
)
print(f"Strategy: {result.strategy_used.value}")  # sub_queries
```

## Custom Abbreviations

Add domain-specific abbreviations for better expansion.

```python
from praisonaiagents import QueryRewriterAgent

agent = QueryRewriterAgent(model="gpt-4o-mini")

# Add custom abbreviations
agent.add_abbreviations({
    "K8s": "Kubernetes",
    "TF": "TensorFlow",
    "PT": "PyTorch"
})

result = agent.rewrite("K8s deployment for TF models")
print(result.primary_query)
# "How to deploy TensorFlow models using Kubernetes?"
```

## Response Structure

```python
result.original_query      # Original user query
result.rewritten_queries   # List of rewritten queries
result.primary_query       # First/main rewritten query
result.strategy_used       # Strategy that was applied
result.hypothetical_document  # HyDE document (if HYDE strategy)
result.step_back_question  # Step-back question (if STEP_BACK)
result.sub_queries         # Sub-queries (if SUB_QUERIES)
result.all_queries         # All queries including original
result.metadata            # Additional metadata
```

## Configuration Options

```python
agent = QueryRewriterAgent(
    name="QueryRewriter",
    model="gpt-4o-mini",
    instructions="Custom instructions",
    verbose=True,
    max_queries=5,          # Max queries for MULTI_QUERY
    temperature=0.3,        # LLM temperature
    max_tokens=500          # Max response tokens
)
```

## Integration with RAG

```python
from praisonaiagents import QueryRewriterAgent, RewriteStrategy

# Initialize rewriter
rewriter = QueryRewriterAgent(model="gpt-4o-mini")

# User query
user_query = "ML best practices"

# Rewrite for better retrieval
result = rewriter.rewrite(user_query, strategy=RewriteStrategy.MULTI_QUERY)

# Use all queries for retrieval
for query in result.all_queries:
    # Retrieve documents using each query
    docs = vector_store.similarity_search(query)
    # Combine results...
```
