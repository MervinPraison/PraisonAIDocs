Research agent with web search for comprehensive topic analysis and report generation.

**Agents: 1** — Single agent handles search, analysis, and synthesis.

## Workflow

1. Receive research topic
2. Search web for relevant sources
3. Analyze and synthesize findings
4. Generate structured report

## Setup

```bash
pip install praisonaiagents praisonai duckduckgo-search
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Run — Python

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent
from praisonaiagents.tools import duckduckgo

agent = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="You are a research agent. Search, analyze, and synthesize information into a comprehensive report.",
    tools=[duckduckgo]
)

result = agent.start("Research the current state of quantum computing in 2024")
print(result)
```

## Run — CLI

```bash
# Research mode
praisonai "Research quantum computing advances" --research --web-search

# With verbose output
praisonai "Research AI trends" --research --web-search --verbose
```

## Run — agents.yaml

```yaml
framework: praisonai
topic: Research Project
roles:
  researcher:
    role: Research Specialist
    goal: Conduct comprehensive research and analysis
    backstory: You are an expert researcher with analytical skills
    tools:
      - duckduckgo
    tasks:
      research_task:
        description: Research the current state of quantum computing in 2024
        expected_output: A comprehensive research report with key findings and sources
```

```bash
praisonai agents.yaml
```

## Serve API

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent
from praisonaiagents.tools import duckduckgo

agent = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="You are a research agent.",
    tools=[duckduckgo]
)

agent.launch(port=8080)
```

```bash
# Test the API
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Research electric vehicle market trends"}'
```
