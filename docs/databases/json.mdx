# JSON

Simple JSON file-based storage for development.

## Quick Start

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    memory={
        "backend": "file",
        "session_id": "my-session"
    }
)

response = agent.start("Hello!")
print(response)
```

## File Location

By default, JSON files are stored in:
- `~/.praison/memory/` for memory data
- `~/.praison/sessions/` for session data

## When to Use

✅ **Good for:**
- Local development
- Testing
- Quick prototyping

❌ **Not recommended for:**
- Production deployments
- Multi-user applications
- Large datasets
