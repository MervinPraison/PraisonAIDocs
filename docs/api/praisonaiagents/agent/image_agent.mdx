# ImageAgent

The `ImageAgent` class is a specialized agent designed for AI image generation tasks. It extends the base `Agent` class and provides seamless integration with various image generation models and providers.

## Overview

`ImageAgent` simplifies the process of generating images using AI models by providing a unified interface for multiple image generation providers including OpenAI DALL-E, Stability AI, and other compatible models through the litellm library.

## Basic Usage

```python
from praisonaiagents import ImageAgent

# Create an image generation agent
artist = ImageAgent(
    role="Digital Artist",
    goal="Create stunning AI-generated artwork based on prompts",
    backstory="You are a creative AI artist capable of generating beautiful images.",
    model="dall-e-3"  # or other supported models
)

# Generate an image
result = artist.chat("Create a serene landscape with mountains at sunset")
print(result)  # Returns the generated image URL or base64 data
```

## Configuration Options

### Core Parameters

- **model** (str): The image generation model to use (e.g., "dall-e-3", "dall-e-2", "stable-diffusion-v1-6-0")
- **api_key** (str, optional): API key for the image generation service
- **style** (str, optional): Style preset for image generation (model-specific)
- **response_format** (str, optional): Format for the response ("url" or "b64_json")
- **timeout** (int, optional): Timeout for image generation requests
- **version** (str, optional): Specific version of the model to use

### Inherited Parameters

All parameters from the base `Agent` class are also available:
- **role**, **goal**, **backstory**, **instructions**
- **tools**, **llm**, **max_iter**, **max_retry**
- **verbose**, **cache**, **markdown**

## Supported Models

ImageAgent supports various image generation models through litellm:

- **OpenAI**: dall-e-3, dall-e-2
- **Stability AI**: stable-diffusion-v1-6-0, stable-diffusion-xl-1024-v1-0
- **Other providers**: Any model supported by litellm's image generation capabilities

## Advanced Features

### Custom Styling

```python
# Create an agent with specific style preferences
artist = ImageAgent(
    role="Style-specific Artist",
    goal="Generate images in specific artistic styles",
    model="dall-e-3",
    style="vivid",  # or "natural" for DALL-E 3
    response_format="url"
)
```

### Async Image Generation

```python
import asyncio

artist = ImageAgent(
    role="Async Artist",
    goal="Generate images asynchronously",
    model="dall-e-3"
)

async def generate_images():
    # Generate multiple images concurrently
    tasks = [
        artist.achat("A futuristic city"),
        artist.achat("An underwater palace"),
        artist.achat("A magical forest")
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

# Run async generation
images = asyncio.run(generate_images())
```

### Integration with Other Agents

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, ImageAgent

# Create a writer agent
writer = Agent(
    role="Creative Writer",
    goal="Write creative descriptions for image generation",
    backstory="You excel at crafting detailed, imaginative prompts."
)

# Create an image agent
artist = ImageAgent(
    role="AI Artist",
    goal="Transform written descriptions into stunning visuals",
    model="dall-e-3"
)

# Writer creates a prompt
prompt = writer.chat("Write a detailed description of a dreamlike fantasy landscape")

# Artist generates the image
image = artist.chat(prompt)
```

## Error Handling

```python
from praisonaiagents import ImageAgent

artist = ImageAgent(
    model="dall-e-3",
    max_retry=3,  # Retry failed generations
    timeout=60    # 60 second timeout
)

try:
    result = artist.chat("Generate an image")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Image generation failed: {e}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Model Selection**: Choose the appropriate model based on your needs:
   - `dall-e-3`: Best quality and prompt adherence
   - `dall-e-2`: Faster and more cost-effective
   - Stable Diffusion variants: Open-source alternatives

2. **Prompt Engineering**: Provide detailed, descriptive prompts for better results:
   ```python
   # Good prompt
   "A serene Japanese garden with cherry blossoms, koi pond, and traditional bridge at sunset"
   
   # Less effective prompt
   "A garden"
   ```

3. **Response Format**: Use URL format for web applications, base64 for direct processing:
   ```python
   # For web display
   artist = ImageAgent(model="dall-e-3", response_format="url")
   
   # For image processing
   artist = ImageAgent(model="dall-e-3", response_format="b64_json")
   ```

4. **API Key Management**: Store API keys securely using environment variables:
   ```python
   import os
   
   artist = ImageAgent(
       model="dall-e-3",
       api_key=os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
   )
   ```

## Limitations

- Image generation can be slow (10-30 seconds depending on the model)
- Some models have content policy restrictions
- Generation costs vary by model and provider
- Output resolution depends on the model capabilities
