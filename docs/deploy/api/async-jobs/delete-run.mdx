## Deletion Behavior

- **Completed jobs**: Can be deleted immediately
- **Cancelled jobs**: Can be deleted immediately
- **Running jobs**: Must be cancelled first before deletion
- **Queued jobs**: Must be cancelled first before deletion

## Example: Cancel and Delete

```python
import httpx

API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:8005"

def force_delete_job(job_id):
    # First, try to cancel if running
    status = httpx.get(f"{API_URL}/api/v1/runs/{job_id}").json()
    
    if status["status"] in ("queued", "running"):
        print(f"Cancelling job {job_id}...")
        httpx.post(f"{API_URL}/api/v1/runs/{job_id}/cancel")
    
    # Now delete
    response = httpx.delete(f"{API_URL}/api/v1/runs/{job_id}")
    
    if response.status_code == 204:
        print(f"Job {job_id} deleted successfully")
        return True
    else:
        print(f"Failed to delete: {response.json()}")
        return False

force_delete_job("run_abc123")
```
