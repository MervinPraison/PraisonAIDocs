Multi-agent hackathon judging: project analysis → technical review → innovation scoring → feedback generation. Includes SQLite score storage, structured output, and API deployment.

## Setup

```bash
# Create environment
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install praisonaiagents praisonai

# Set API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Create Sample Data

```bash
# Create project submissions
cat > submissions.json << 'EOF'

## Run: agents.yaml

Create `agents.yaml`:

```yaml
framework: praisonai
topic: "hackathon project judging"
roles:
  reviewer:
    role: Project Reviewer
    goal: Understand project scope and implementation
    backstory: Experienced hackathon organizer
    tasks:

# View judging history
praisonai --history 10 --user-id judge_panel

# Check metrics
praisonai --metrics

# Export scores
praisonai --save hackathon_results
```

## Serve API

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, tool
import json

@tool
def quick_score(innovation: int, technical: int, presentation: int, impact: int) -> str:
    """Quick weighted score calculation."""
    weights = {"innovation": 0.25, "technical": 0.25, "presentation": 0.25, "impact": 0.25}

    else:
        tier = "Participant"
    
    return json.dumps({"total_score": round(total, 1), "tier": tier})

agent = Agent(
    name="JudgingAPI",
    instructions="Calculate hackathon project scores.",
    tools=[quick_score]
)

agent.launch(path="/score", port=8000)
```

Test:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/score \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Score project: innovation 85, technical 90, presentation 80, impact 75"}'
```

## Cleanup

```bash
rm -f hackathon.db submissions.json criteria.json
deactivate
```
