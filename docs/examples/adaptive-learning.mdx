Multi-agent adaptive learning: skill assessment → content generation → performance evaluation → difficulty adaptation. Includes SQLite student progress tracking, structured output, and API deployment.

## Setup

```bash
# Create environment
python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# Install packages
pip install praisonaiagents praisonai

# Set API key
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
```

## Create Sample Data

```bash
# Create student profiles
cat > students.json << 'EOF'
[
  {"id": "STU001", "name": "Alice", "level": "beginner", "topics_completed": ["intro"], "score_avg": 65},
  {"id": "STU002", "name": "Bob", "level": "intermediate", "topics_completed": ["intro", "basics", "functions"], "score_avg": 82},
  {"id": "STU003", "name": "Carol", "level": "advanced", "topics_completed": ["intro", "basics", "functions", "oop", "async"], "score_avg": 91}
]
EOF

# Create curriculum
cat > curriculum.json << 'EOF'
{
  "beginner": ["variables", "data_types", "control_flow"],
  "intermediate": ["functions", "oop", "error_handling"],
  "advanced": ["async", "decorators", "metaclasses"]
}
EOF
```

## Run: Python Code

```python

# Structured output

```

## Run: CLI

```bash
# Assess single student
praisonai "Create learning plan for beginner Python student" --verbose

# With persistence
praisonai "Generate adaptive quiz for intermediate level" --memory --user-id tutor1

# Interactive tutoring
praisonai --chat-mode --memory --user-id learning_system
```

## Run: agents.yaml

Create `agents.yaml`:

```yaml
framework: praisonai
topic: "adaptive learning system"
roles:
  assessor:
    role: Skill Assessor
    goal: Evaluate student knowledge level
    backstory: Expert at educational assessment
    tasks:
      assess:
        description: |
          Assess student:
          - Current knowledge level
          - Completed topics
          - Average score
          - Learning gaps
        expected_output: Skill assessment report
        
  planner:
    role: Curriculum Planner
    goal: Create personalized learning paths
    backstory: Expert at curriculum design
    tasks:
      plan:
        description: |
          Create learning plan:
          - Next topics to learn
          - Difficulty level
          - Estimated time
          - Prerequisites
        expected_output: Personalized learning plan
        
  generator:
    role: Content Generator
    goal: Create engaging learning content
    backstory: Expert at educational content
    tasks:
      generate:
        description: |
          Generate content:
          - Explanations
          - Examples
          - Quizzes
          - Practice exercises
        expected_output: Learning materials
```

Run:

```bash
praisonai agents.yaml --verbose
```

## Monitor & Verify

```bash
# View learning history
praisonai --history 10 --user-id tutor1

# Check metrics
praisonai --metrics

# Export progress
praisonai --save student_progress
```

## Serve API

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, tool
import json

@tool
def quick_assessment(score: int, topics_completed: int) -> str:
    """Quick skill level assessment."""
    if score >= 90 and topics_completed >= 5:
        level = "advanced"
        next_topics = ["decorators", "metaclasses"]
    elif score >= 70 and topics_completed >= 3:
        level = "intermediate"
        next_topics = ["oop", "error_handling"]
    else:
        level = "beginner"
        next_topics = ["variables", "control_flow"]
    
    return json.dumps({"level": level, "next_topics": next_topics})

agent = Agent(
    name="LearningAPI",
    instructions="Assess student level and recommend topics.",
    tools=[quick_assessment]
)

agent.launch(path="/assess", port=8000)
```

Test:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/assess \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Assess student with score 75 and 4 topics completed"}'
```

## Cleanup

```bash
rm -f learning.db students.json curriculum.json
deactivate
```
