A workflow optimization pattern where agents handle repetitive tasks through automated loops, processing multiple instances efficiently while maintaining consistency.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install Package">
        First, install the PraisonAI Agents package:
        ```bash
        pip install praisonaiagents
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set API Key">
        Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable in your terminal:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a file">
        Create a new file `repetitive_agent.py` with the basic setup:
        ```python
        from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents

        agent = Agent(
            instructions="You are a loop agent that creating a loop of tasks."
        )

        task = Task(
            description="Create the list of tasks to be looped through.",
            agent=agent,
            task_type="loop",
            input_file="tasks.csv"
        )

        agents = PraisonAIAgents(
            agents=[agent],
            tasks=[task],
            process="workflow",
            max_iter=30
        )

        agents.start()
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Start Agents">
        Type this in your terminal to run your agents:
        ```bash
        python repetitive_agent.py
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Requirements**
  - Python 3.10 or higher
  - OpenAI API key. Generate OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Use Other models using [this guide](/models).

## Loop Tasks with File Processing

Loop tasks can automatically process CSV and text files to create dynamic subtasks. This powerful feature enables batch processing of data without manual task creation.

### How File Processing Works

When a loop task has an `input_file` parameter:
1. The system reads the CSV file using Python's csv.reader
2. Each row becomes a separate subtask
3. Subtasks inherit properties from the parent loop task
4. Tasks are executed sequentially with proper context passing

### CSV File Format

Loop tasks support multiple CSV formats:

#### Simple Format
```csv
name,issue
John,Billing problem
Jane,Technical issue
Sarah,Password reset
```

#### Q&A Format
```csv
question,answer
What is 2+2?,4
What is the capital of France?,Paris
```

#### Single Column Format
```csv
task
Analyze customer feedback
Process refund request
Update user profile
```

### Complete Example: Customer Support System

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents

# Create a CSV file with customer issues
with open("customers.csv", "w") as f:
    f.write("name,issue\n")
    f.write("John,Billing problem with subscription\n") 
    f.write("Jane,Technical issue with login\n")
    f.write("Sarah,Request for feature enhancement\n")

# Create specialized support agent
support_agent = Agent(
    name="Support Agent",
    role="Customer support specialist",
    goal="Resolve customer issues efficiently",
    backstory="Expert support agent with years of experience",
    llm="gpt-4o-mini"  # Specify the LLM model
)

# Loop task automatically creates subtasks from CSV
loop_task = Task(
    name="Process all customers",
    description="Handle each customer issue",
    expected_output="Resolution for the customer issue",
    agent=support_agent,
    task_type="loop",
    input_file="customers.csv"  # Automatically processes each row
)

# Use PraisonAIAgents with workflow process
agents = PraisonAIAgents(
    agents=[support_agent], 
    tasks=[loop_task],
    process="workflow",  # Required for loop tasks
    max_iter=10  # Prevent infinite loops
)

# Start processing
results = agents.start()

# Each row will be processed as:
# - Subtask 1: "Handle each customer issue: John,Billing problem with subscription"
# - Subtask 2: "Handle each customer issue: Jane,Technical issue with login"
# - Subtask 3: "Handle each customer issue: Sarah,Request for feature enhancement"
```

### Processing Text Files

Loop tasks can also process text files line by line:

```python
# Create a text file with URLs
with open("urls.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write("https://example.com\n")
    f.write("https://test.com\n")
    f.write("https://demo.com\n")

# Create URL analyzer agent
url_agent = Agent(
    name="URL Analyzer",
    role="Website analyzer",
    goal="Analyze websites for SEO and performance"
)

# Process each URL
url_task = Task(
    name="Analyze URLs",
    description="Analyze each website",
    expected_output="SEO and performance report",
    agent=url_agent,
    task_type="loop",
    input_file="urls.txt"  # Each line becomes a subtask
)
```

### Advanced Features

#### Subtask Inheritance
Subtasks automatically inherit from the parent loop task:
- Agent assignment
- Expected output format
- Callbacks and hooks
- Task configuration

#### Context Passing
Each subtask receives:
- The specific row data
- Parent task context
- Previous subtask results (when sequential)

#### Error Handling
```python
# Loop tasks handle errors gracefully
loop_task = Task(
    name="Process data",
    description="Process each data entry",
    expected_output="Processed result",
    agent=agent,
    task_type="loop",
    input_file="data.csv",
    on_failure="continue"  # Continue processing even if one row fails
)
```

### Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="File Preparation" icon="file-check">
    - Ensure CSV files are properly formatted
    - Use quotes for fields with commas
    - Handle empty rows appropriately
    - Validate data before processing
  </Card>
  <Card title="Performance" icon="gauge">
    - Set appropriate `max_iter` values
    - Consider batch size for large files
    - Monitor memory usage
    - Use efficient agents for repetitive tasks
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Common Use Cases

1. **Customer Support**: Process support tickets from CSV
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyze multiple datasets sequentially
3. **Content Generation**: Create content for multiple topics
4. **URL Processing**: Analyze or scrape multiple websites
5. **Bulk Operations**: Update multiple records or entities

### Important Notes

<Warning>
  - Always use `PraisonAIAgents` class, not `Process` directly
  - Set `process="workflow"` for loop tasks to work properly
  - Include `max_iter` to prevent infinite loops
  - The CSV file must exist before starting the process
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Loop Issues" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If loops aren't working as expected:
    - Verify input file format
    - Check task configurations
    - Enable verbose mode for debugging
  </Card>

  <Card title="Performance Issues" icon="gauge-high">
    If processing is slow:
    - Check batch sizes
    - Verify resource allocation
    - Monitor memory usage
