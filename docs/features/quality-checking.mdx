Quality checking in PraisonAI automatically evaluates task outputs, calculates quality scores, and stores high-quality results in long-term memory for future reference.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install Package">
        First, install the PraisonAI Agents package:
        ```bash
        pip install praisonaiagents
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Enable Quality Checking">
        Create a task with quality checking enabled:
        ```python
        from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents, Memory

        # Create agent with memory
        agent = Agent(
            name="Quality Writer",
            role="Content creator",
            goal="Produce high-quality content",
            memory=Memory(provider="chroma")  # Required for quality storage
        )

        # Task with quality checking
        task = Task(
            name="Write article",
            description="Write a comprehensive article about AI ethics",
            expected_output="1000-word article with introduction, body, and conclusion",
            agent=agent,
            quality_check=True  # Enable automatic quality assessment
        )

        # Run task
        agents = PraisonAIAgents(
            agents=[agent],
            tasks=[task]
        )
        
        result = agents.start()
        
        # Quality score is automatically calculated
        print(f"Quality score: {result['task_results']['Write article'].metadata.get('quality_score')}")
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

## How Quality Checking Works

When `quality_check=True` is set on a task:

1. **Output Generation**: Agent completes the task normally
2. **Quality Assessment**: System automatically evaluates the output
3. **Score Calculation**: Assigns a quality score (0.0 to 1.0)
4. **Memory Storage**: High-quality outputs (score > 0.7) are stored in long-term memory
5. **Metadata Tracking**: Quality metrics are saved with the result

## Quality Metrics

The quality assessment evaluates multiple factors:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Completeness" icon="list-check">
    - Does output match expected format?
    - Are all requirements addressed?
    - Is the response comprehensive?
  </Card>
  <Card title="Coherence" icon="link">
    - Is the output well-structured?
    - Does it flow logically?
    - Are ideas connected properly?
  </Card>

## Complete Examples

### Example 1: Blog Post with Quality Tracking

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents, Memory

# Create writer with memory for quality tracking
blog_writer = Agent(
    name="Blog Writer",
    role="Professional blogger",
    goal="Create engaging, high-quality blog posts",
    backstory="Expert writer with years of experience",
    memory=Memory(config={
        "provider": "rag",
        "use_embedding": True,
        "rag_db_path": ".praison/blog_memory"
    })
)

# Define quality task
blog_task = Task(
    name="Write blog post",
    description="Write a 1000-word blog post about 'The Future of Remote Work'",
    expected_output="""A complete blog post with:
    - Catchy title
    - Introduction (150-200 words)
    - 3-4 main sections with subheadings
    - Conclusion (150-200 words)
    - Call to action""",
    agent=blog_writer,
    quality_check=True
)

# Run task
workflow = PraisonAIAgents(
    agents=[blog_writer],
    tasks=[blog_task]
)

result = workflow.start()

# Access quality information
task_result = result['task_results']['Write blog post']
print(f"Quality Score: {task_result.metadata.get('quality_score', 0):.2f}")
print(f"Stored in Memory: {task_result.metadata.get('stored_in_memory', False)}")

# High-quality outputs can be retrieved later
if task_result.metadata.get('stored_in_memory'):
    # Search for similar high-quality content
    similar_posts = blog_writer.memory.search_long_term(
        "blog posts about remote work",
        relevance_cutoff=0.7
    )
    print(f"Found {len(similar_posts)} similar high-quality posts")
```

### Example 2: Code Generation with Quality Metrics

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents, Memory

# Code generator with quality tracking
code_agent = Agent(
    name="Code Generator",
    role="Senior developer",
    goal="Write clean, efficient, well-documented code",
    llm="gpt-4",  # Better model for code generation
    memory=Memory(provider="chroma")
)

# Multiple tasks with quality checking
tasks = [
    Task(
        name="API endpoint",
        description="Create a REST API endpoint for user authentication",
        expected_output="Complete Python code with Flask, including error handling and documentation",
        agent=code_agent,
        quality_check=True
    ),
    Task(
        name="Unit tests",
        description="Write comprehensive unit tests for the authentication endpoint",
        expected_output="Pytest test cases covering all scenarios",
        agent=code_agent,
        quality_check=True
    ),
    Task(
        name="Documentation",
        description="Write API documentation for the authentication endpoint",
        expected_output="OpenAPI/Swagger documentation with examples",
        agent=code_agent,
        quality_check=True
    )
]

# Run all tasks
workflow = PraisonAIAgents(
    agents=[code_agent],
    tasks=tasks,
    process="sequential"
)

results = workflow.start()

# Analyze quality across tasks
quality_report = {}
for task_name, result in results['task_results'].items():
    quality_report[task_name] = {
        'score': result.metadata.get('quality_score', 0),
        'stored': result.metadata.get('stored_in_memory', False)
    }

print("Quality Report:")
for task, metrics in quality_report.items():
    print(f"- {task}: Score={metrics['score']:.2f}, Stored={metrics['stored']}")

# Calculate average quality
avg_quality = sum(m['score'] for m in quality_report.values()) / len(quality_report)
print(f"\nAverage Quality Score: {avg_quality:.2f}")
```

### Example 3: Research with Quality Filtering

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents, Memory
from typing import List, Dict

# Research agent with quality memory
researcher = Agent(
    name="Research Analyst",
    role="Research specialist",
    goal="Conduct thorough research with verified sources",
    tools=["web_search", "pdf_reader"],
    memory=Memory(provider="chroma")
)

# Custom quality checker for research
def research_quality_check(output: str) -> float:
    """Custom quality scoring for research outputs"""
    score = 0.0
    
    # Check for citations
    if "References:" in output or "[1]" in output:
        score += 0.3
    
    # Check for multiple sources
    source_indicators = ["according to", "study shows", "research indicates"]
    sources_found = sum(1 for indicator in source_indicators if indicator in output.lower())
    score += min(0.3, sources_found * 0.1)
    
    # Check for balanced perspective
    if "however" in output.lower() or "on the other hand" in output.lower():
        score += 0.2
    
    # Check for conclusion
    if "conclusion" in output.lower() or "in summary" in output.lower():
        score += 0.2
    
    return min(1.0, score)

# Research task with custom quality
research_task = Task(
    name="Market research",
    description="Research the electric vehicle market trends for 2024-2025",
    expected_output="Comprehensive research report with sources",
    agent=researcher,
    quality_check=True,
    quality_checker=research_quality_check  # Custom quality function
)

# Execute research
workflow = PraisonAIAgents(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[research_task]
)

result = workflow.start()

# Only high-quality research is stored
if result['task_results']['Market research'].metadata.get('stored_in_memory'):
    print("High-quality research stored for future reference")
    
    # Retrieve high-quality research on similar topics
    related_research = researcher.memory.search_long_term(
        "electric vehicle market analysis",
        relevance_cutoff=0.8,
        limit=5
    )
    
    print(f"\nFound {len(related_research)} related high-quality research pieces")
```

### Example 4: Iterative Quality Improvement

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents, Memory

# Agent that improves based on quality feedback
learning_agent = Agent(
    name="Learning Writer",
    role="Adaptive content creator",
    goal="Continuously improve content quality",
    memory=Memory(provider="chroma")
)

# Task that uses previous high-quality examples
def create_improved_task(topic: str, previous_score: float = 0.0):
    instruction = f"Write about {topic}."
    
    if previous_score > 0:
        instruction += f" Previous attempt scored {previous_score:.2f}."
        
        # Retrieve high-quality examples
        examples = learning_agent.memory.search_long_term(
            f"high quality content about {topic}",
            relevance_cutoff=0.8,
            limit=2
        )
        
        if examples:
            instruction += " Use these high-quality examples as reference:"
            for ex in examples:
                instruction += f"\n- {ex['memory'][:100]}..."
    
    return Task(
        name=f"Write about {topic}",
        description=instruction,
        expected_output="High-quality article",
        agent=learning_agent,
        quality_check=True
    )

# Iterative improvement loop
topics = ["AI Ethics", "Quantum Computing", "Climate Technology"]
quality_history = {}

for topic in topics:
    print(f"\nWorking on: {topic}")
    
    # Get previous score if exists
    prev_score = quality_history.get(topic, 0.0)
    
    # Create task with context
    task = create_improved_task(topic, prev_score)
    
    # Execute
    workflow = PraisonAIAgents(
        agents=[learning_agent],
        tasks=[task]
    )
    
    result = workflow.start()
    
    # Track quality
    score = result['task_results'][f'Write about {topic}'].metadata.get('quality_score', 0)
    quality_history[topic] = score
    
    print(f"Quality Score: {score:.2f}")
    
    # Retry if quality is low
    if score < 0.7:
        print("Quality below threshold, retrying with examples...")
        # The next iteration will use high-quality examples
```

## Configuration Options

### Task-Level Configuration

```python
task = Task(
    name="Quality task",
    description="Task description",
    agent=agent,
    quality_check=True,  # Enable quality checking
    quality_threshold=0.75,  # Custom threshold (default: 0.7)
    quality_checker=custom_function,  # Custom quality function
    store_only_high_quality=True  # Only store if quality > threshold
)
```

### Memory Configuration for Quality

```python
# Configure memory for quality-based storage
memory = Memory(config={
    "provider": "rag",
    "use_embedding": True,
    "quality_weight": 0.3,  # Weight quality in search results
    "min_quality_to_store": 0.7,  # Minimum quality for storage
    "quality_decay_days": 30  # Reduce quality score over time
})
```

## Quality Score Calculation

The default quality scoring considers:

1. **Task Completion** (40%)
   - Does output match expected format?
   - Are requirements met?

2. **Content Quality** (30%)
   - Grammar and coherence
   - Logical flow
   - Appropriate length

3. **Relevance** (20%)
   - On-topic content
   - Addresses the prompt

4. **Creativity/Insight** (10%)
   - Novel approaches
   - Valuable insights

### Custom Quality Functions

```python
def custom_quality_scorer(task_output) -> float:
    """
    Custom quality scoring logic
    Returns: float between 0.0 and 1.0
    """
    score = 0.0
    content = task_output.raw
    
    # Your custom scoring logic
    if len(content) > 1000:
        score += 0.2
    
    if "conclusion" in content.lower():
        score += 0.1
    
    # ... more criteria
    
    return min(1.0, score)

# Use in task
task = Task(
    name="Custom quality task",
    quality_check=True,
    quality_checker=custom_quality_scorer
)
```

## Quality Metrics Dashboard

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
import pandas as pd

def analyze_quality_trends(agent: Agent, days: int = 7):
    """Analyze quality trends over time"""
    
    # Retrieve recent tasks with quality scores
    end_date = datetime.now()
    start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=days)
    
    # Get quality data from memory
    quality_data = []
    
    # Search for recent outputs
    recent_outputs = agent.memory.search_long_term(
        f"outputs from {agent.name}",

    # Create DataFrame for analysis
    df = pd.DataFrame(quality_data)
    
    if not df.empty:
        print(f"Quality Analysis for {agent.name}")
        print("-" * 50)
        print(f"Average Quality Score: {df['score'].mean():.2f}")
        print(f"Highest Score: {df['score'].max():.2f}")
        print(f"Lowest Score: {df['score'].min():.2f}")
        print(f"Storage Rate: {df['stored'].mean()*100:.1f}%")
        
        # Group by task
        task_quality = df.groupby('task')['score'].agg(['mean', 'count'])
        print("\nQuality by Task:")
