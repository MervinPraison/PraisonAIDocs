# Planning Mode

Planning Mode is a powerful feature that separates research and analysis from execution. Instead of immediately making changes, the AI first creates a detailed implementation plan that you can review, edit, and approve before any code is modified.

## Cursor Plan Mode

Cursor's Plan Mode creates detailed implementation plans before writing any code. The agent researches your codebase, asks clarifying questions, and generates a reviewable plan.

### How to Activate

Press `Shift+Tab` from the chat input to rotate to Plan Mode. Cursor also suggests it automatically for complex tasks.

### How It Works

1. **Agent asks clarifying questions** to understand your requirements
2. **Researches your codebase** to gather relevant context
3. **Creates a comprehensive implementation plan**
4. **You review and edit** the plan through chat or markdown files
5. **Click to build** the plan when ready

### Plan Storage

Plans open as ephemeral virtual files. To save a plan to your workspace, click "Save to workspace" to store it in `.cursor/plans/` for future reference, team sharing, and documentation.

### Agent To-Dos

Cursor can break down longer tasks into manageable steps with dependencies:

- Agent automatically creates to-do lists for complex tasks
- Each item can have dependencies on other tasks
- The list updates in real-time as work progresses
- Completed tasks are marked off automatically

### Queued Messages

Queue follow-up messages while Agent is working:

1. While Agent is working, type your next instruction
2. Press `Ctrl+Enter` to add it to the queue
3. Messages appear in order below the active task
4. Agent processes them sequentially after finishing

## Windsurf Planning Mode

Windsurf's Planning Mode uses persistent markdown files for long-term AI planning. A specialized planning agent continuously refines the plan while your selected model focuses on execution.

### How to Activate

Click the Planning Mode toggle button below the Cascade input box. Planning Mode is enabled by default for Pro, Teams, and Enterprise users.

### How It Works

1. **Enable Planning Mode** via the toggle button
2. **Cascade creates a plan** in a persistent markdown file
3. **Review and edit** the plan directly or ask Cascade to update it
4. **Cascade executes** based on the approved plan
5. **Plan updates automatically** as new information (like Memories) is discovered

### Plan Storage

Plans are saved in `~/.codeium/windsurf/brain/` directory, so they won't be checked into your repository.

### Plans and Todo Lists

Cascade has built-in planning capabilities:

- A specialized planning agent continuously refines the long-term plan
- Your selected model focuses on short-term actions based on that plan
- Cascade creates a Todo list within the conversation to track progress
- Ask Cascade to make updates to the Todo list as needed

### Queued Messages

While waiting for Cascade to finish:

- Type your message and press `Enter` to queue it
- Press `Enter` again on an empty text box to send immediately
- Delete any message from the queue before it's sent

### Opus 4.5 Plan Mode

Enhanced interactive planning with Claude Opus 4.5:

1. You describe the task with requirements and context
2. Claude asks clarifying questions about ambiguous requirements
3. Claude creates `plan.md` with task breakdown and dependencies
4. You review and edit the plan as needed
5. Claude executes using Sonnet 4.5

Access via `/model` command: "Use Opus 4.5 in plan mode, Sonnet 4.5 otherwise"

## Gemini CLI Plan Mode

Gemini CLI can operate in Plan Mode through custom instructions in your `GEMINI.md` file. This makes Gemini act like a senior engineer: understand the request, investigate the codebase, and present a clear plan for approval.

### How to Activate

Add Plan Mode instructions to your `GEMINI.md` file:

```markdown
# GEMINI.md

You are operating in Plan Mode. Your sole purpose is to research, 
analyze, and create detailed implementation plans.

## Core Principles
- Strictly Read-Only: Inspect files, navigate code, search the web
- No Modifications: Do not edit, create, or delete files
- No Commands: Do not run shell commands that make changes

## Steps
1. Acknowledge and analyze the user's request
2. Output your reasoning before the plan
3. Create a detailed, step-by-step implementation plan
4. Present for approval before any execution
```

### Output Format

Your plan should include:

1. **Analysis**: Findings and reasoning behind your strategy
2. **Plan**: Numbered list of precise implementation steps
3. **Approval Request**: Final step asking for user confirmation

### Best Practices

- Keep the plan focused and actionable
- Include file paths and specific changes
- Note dependencies between steps
- Estimate complexity for each step

## OpenAI Codex Plan Mode

Codex CLI includes a `/plan` slash command for creating implementation plans. It also supports approval modes that control how much Codex can do without confirmation.

### How to Activate

Use the `/plan` slash command in the interactive session, or use the `--approval` flag when launching.

### Approval Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Auto** (default) | Read, edit, and run commands within working directory |
| **Read Only** | Browse files but won't make changes until you approve |
| **Full Access** | Work across your machine without asking |

Switch modes with `/approvals` inside an interactive session.

### How It Works

1. **Launch Codex** with `codex` command
2. **Use `/plan`** to enter planning mode
3. **Codex explains its plan** before making changes
4. **Approve or reject** steps inline
5. **Review transcript** of all actions

### Resuming Plans

Codex stores transcripts locally for resuming:

```bash
# Resume most recent session
codex resume --last

# Resume specific session
codex resume <SESSION_ID>

# Resume with new instructions
codex exec resume --last "Implement the plan"
```

## PraisonAI Planning Mode

PraisonAI supports planning mode through the `PlanManager` class, allowing you to create, review, and execute structured plans programmatically.

### Quick Start

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent
from praisonaiagents.memory import PlanManager

agent = Agent(name="Planner")
plan_manager = PlanManager()

# Create a plan
plan = plan_manager.create_plan(
    name="Feature Implementation",
    description="Add user authentication",
    steps=[
        {"name": "Research", "action": "Analyze existing auth patterns"},
        {"name": "Design", "action": "Create authentication flow diagram"},
        {"name": "Implement", "action": "Write authentication code"},
        {"name": "Test", "action": "Add unit and integration tests"}
    ]
)

# Execute with approval
result = plan_manager.execute(
    plan.name,
    executor=lambda prompt: agent.chat(prompt),
    require_approval=True  # Pause for approval before each step
)
```

### Plan File Format

Plans are stored as markdown files in `.praison/plans/`:

```markdown
---
name: Feature Implementation
description: Add user authentication
status: pending
created: 2024-01-15T10:00:00Z
---

## Step 1: Research
Analyze existing auth patterns in the codebase.

```action
Search for authentication-related files and patterns.
Document current implementation approach.
```

## Step 2: Design
Create authentication flow diagram.

```action
Design the authentication flow.
Identify required components and dependencies.
```

## Step 3: Implement
Write authentication code.

```action
Implement the designed authentication flow.
Follow existing code patterns.
```

## Step 4: Test
Add unit and integration tests.

```action
Write comprehensive tests for the new authentication.
Ensure all edge cases are covered.
```
```

### Programmatic API

```python
from praisonaiagents.memory import PlanManager

manager = PlanManager(workspace_path="/path/to/project")

# List all plans
plans = manager.list_plans()

# Get a specific plan
plan = manager.get_plan("Feature Implementation")

# Update plan status
manager.update_step_status(plan.name, step_index=0, status="completed")

# Get plan statistics
stats = manager.get_stats()
print(f"Total plans: {stats['total_plans']}")
print(f"Pending: {stats['pending']}")
print(f"In Progress: {stats['in_progress']}")
print(f"Completed: {stats['completed']}")
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with clear requirements">
    Describe your end goal clearly. The AI creates more accurate plans when it understands the full scope.

  <Accordion title="Edit plans iteratively">
    Don't hesitate to ask for plan modifications. It's cheaper to fix a plan than to fix code.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use for complex tasks">
    Planning mode shines for multi-step tasks. For simple changes, direct execution may be faster.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Save important plans">
