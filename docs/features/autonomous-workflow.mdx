An agent-based workflow where LLMs act autonomously within a loop, interacting with their environment and receiving feedback to refine their actions and decisions.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
    <Step title="Install Package">
        First, install the PraisonAI Agents package:
        ```bash
        pip install praisonaiagents
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Set API Key">
        Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable in your terminal:
        ```bash
        export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Create a file">
        Create a new file `app.py` with the basic setup:
        ```python
        from praisonaiagents import Agent, AgentFlow
        from praisonaiagents import route, repeat

        # Create monitor agent that analyzes environment state
        monitor_agent = Agent(
            name="Monitor",
            role="Environment Monitor",
            goal="Monitor and analyze system state",
            instructions="Analyze the current state. Respond with ONLY 'normal', 'critical', or 'optimal'."
        )

        # Create action agents for different states
        maintenance_agent = Agent(
            name="Maintenance",
            role="System Maintainer",
            goal="Maintain normal system operations",
            instructions="Perform routine maintenance tasks. Report what was done."
        )

        emergency_agent = Agent(
            name="Emergency",
            role="Emergency Responder",
            goal="Handle critical situations",
            instructions="Address the critical issue immediately. Provide resolution steps."
        )

        optimization_agent = Agent(
            name="Optimizer",
            role="System Optimizer",
            goal="Optimize system performance",
            instructions="The system is optimal. Suggest further improvements."
        )

        # Create feedback agent
        feedback_agent = Agent(
            name="Feedback",
            role="Feedback Processor",
            goal="Process and learn from feedback",
            instructions="Analyze the action taken and provide feedback for improvement."
        )

        # Check if optimal state reached
        def is_optimal(ctx) -> bool:
            return "optimal" in ctx.previous_result.lower()

        # Create autonomous workflow
        workflow = AgentFlow(
            steps=[
                repeat(
                    monitor_agent,  # Monitor keeps checking state
                    until=is_optimal,
                    max_iterations=3
                ),
                route({
                    "normal": [maintenance_agent],
                    "critical": [emergency_agent],
                    "optimal": [optimization_agent]
                }),
                feedback_agent
            ]
        )

        result = workflow.start("Monitor the AI system health")
        print(f"Result: {result['output'][:500]}...")
        ```
    </Step>

    <Step title="Start Workflow">
        Type this in your terminal to run your workflow:
        ```bash
        python app.py
        ```
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Requirements**
  - Python 3.10 or higher
  - OpenAI API key. Generate OpenAI API key [here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys). Use Other models using [this guide](/models).   
  - Basic understanding of Python

## Configuration Options

```python
# Create a monitor agent
monitor = Agent(
    name="Environment Monitor",
    role="State analyzer",
    goal="Monitor and analyze state",
    tools=[get_environment_state],  # Environment monitoring tools
      # Enable detailed logging
)

# Create an action agent
action = Agent(
    name="Action Executor",
    role="Action performer",
    goal="Execute appropriate actions",
    tools=[perform_action]  # Action execution tools
)

# Create monitoring task
monitor_task = Task(
    name="monitor_environment",
    description="Monitor environment state",
    agent=monitor,
    is_start=True,
    task_type="decision",
    condition={
        "normal": ["execute_action"],
        "critical": ["execute_action"],
        "optimal": "exit"
    }
)

# Create feedback loop task
feedback_task = Task(
    name="process_feedback",
    description="Process and adapt",
    agent=feedback_agent,
    next_tasks=["monitor_environment"],  # Create feedback loop
    context=[monitor_task, action_task]  # Access history
)
```

## Troubleshooting

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Monitoring Issues" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If monitoring fails:
    - Check environment access
    - Verify state detection
    - Enable verbose mode for debugging
  </Card>

  <Card title="Adaptation Flow" icon="diagram-project">
    If adaptation is incorrect:
    - Review feedback processing
    - Check action outcomes
    - Verify learning loop
  </Card>
