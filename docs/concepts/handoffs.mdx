## Overview

Agent handoffs enable seamless task delegation between agents in PraisonAI. When an agent encounters a task outside its expertise, it can dynamically hand off the conversation to a more suitable agent, ensuring optimal task completion.

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step>
    Install praisonaiagents
    ```bash
    pip install praisonaiagents
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Import required components
    ```python
    from praisonaiagents import Agent, handoff
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Create agents with handoff capabilities
    ```python
    # Customer service agent that can handoff to specialists
    customer_service = Agent(
        name="CustomerService",
        instructions="You are a customer service agent. For technical issues, handoff to TechnicalSupport.",
        handoffs=["TechnicalSupport", "Billing"]
    )
    
    # Technical support specialist
    tech_support = Agent(
        name="TechnicalSupport",
        instructions="You are a technical support specialist. Resolve technical issues."
    )
    
    # Billing specialist
    billing = Agent(
        name="Billing",
        instructions="You are a billing specialist. Handle payment and subscription issues."
    )
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step>
    Use handoffs naturally in conversation
    ```python
    # Customer service agent automatically hands off when needed
    response = customer_service.chat("I'm having trouble installing the software")
    # This will trigger a handoff to TechnicalSupport
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## How Handoffs Work

### 1. **Handoff Detection**
Agents identify when they need to delegate based on:
- Task complexity beyond their expertise
- Specific keywords or patterns in user requests
- Explicit handoff instructions in their role

### 2. **Target Selection**
The system selects the best agent using:
- Predefined handoff targets in agent configuration
- Dynamic selection based on agent capabilities
- Custom selection logic via callbacks

### 3. **Context Transfer**
When handing off, the system:
- Packages the entire conversation history
- Includes any relevant metadata
- Maintains user context and preferences

### 4. **Seamless Continuation**
The receiving agent:
- Gets full context of the conversation
- Continues naturally without user intervention
- Can hand back or to another agent if needed

## Basic Usage

### Simple Handoff Configuration

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

# Agent with specific handoff targets
receptionist = Agent(
    name="Receptionist",
    role="Virtual Receptionist",
    goal="Route inquiries to appropriate departments",
    backstory="You are a helpful receptionist who directs people to the right specialist.",
    handoffs=["Sales", "Support", "HR"]
)

# Specialist agents
sales = Agent(
    name="Sales",
    role="Sales Representative",
    goal="Help customers with purchases and product information"
)

support = Agent(
    name="Support", 
    role="Support Specialist",
    goal="Resolve technical issues and answer questions"
)
```

### Using the Handoff Tool

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, handoff

agent = Agent(
    name="Assistant",
    instructions="You are a general assistant. Use handoff for specialized tasks.",
    tools=[handoff]  # Provide handoff as a tool
)

# The agent can now use handoff() function when needed
response = agent.chat("I need help with a complex math problem")
# Agent may call: handoff(agent="MathExpert", message="User needs help with complex math")
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Handoff Names

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, handoff

# Create handoff with custom name
transfer_to_human = handoff(
    name="transfer_to_human",
    description="Transfer the conversation to a human agent when the user requests it"
)

chatbot = Agent(
    name="Chatbot",
    instructions="You are an AI assistant. Transfer to human when requested.",
    tools=[transfer_to_human]
)
```

### Handoff Callbacks

```python
def on_handoff(from_agent, to_agent, context):
    """Custom logic when handoff occurs"""
    print(f"Handoff: {from_agent} -> {to_agent}")
    # Log the handoff
    # Update metrics
    # Send notifications
    return True  # Allow handoff to proceed

agent = Agent(
    name="Agent",
    handoffs=["Specialist"],
    handoff_callback=on_handoff
)
```

### Structured Input with Pydantic

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from praisonaiagents import handoff, Agent

class CustomerInfo(BaseModel):
    name: str
    account_id: str
    issue_type: str
    priority: int

structured_handoff = handoff(
    input_model=CustomerInfo,
    description="Handoff with structured customer information"
)

agent = Agent(
    name="Intake",
    tools=[structured_handoff]
)
```

## Handoff Filters

Control which agents can receive handoffs using filters:

```python
from praisonaiagents.agent.handoff import handoff_filters

# Default filters available
filters = handoff_filters()
# Returns: ["all", "none", "self", "other", "team:"]

# Use in agent configuration
agent = Agent(
    name="TeamLead",
    handoff_filter="team:support",  # Only handoff to support team
    handoffs=["Agent1", "Agent2", "Agent3"]
)

# Filter examples:
# "all" - Can receive from any agent (default)
# "none" - Cannot receive handoffs
# "self" - Can only receive from itself
# "other" - Can receive from any agent except itself
# "team:xyz" - Can only receive from agents in team 'xyz'
```

## Integration Patterns

### Multi-Agent Workflow with Handoffs

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Task, PraisonAIAgents

# Create interconnected agents
coordinator = Agent(
    name="Coordinator",
    role="Workflow Coordinator",
    handoffs=["Researcher", "Writer", "Reviewer"]
)

researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    role="Research Specialist",
    handoffs=["Coordinator", "Writer"]
)

writer = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    role="Content Writer",
    handoffs=["Coordinator", "Reviewer"]
)

# Create workflow
workflow = PraisonAIAgents(
    agents=[coordinator, researcher, writer],
    process="sequential",
    memory=True
)
```

### Conditional Handoffs

```python
def should_handoff(message: str) -> str:
    """Determine which agent to handoff to based on message content"""
    if "technical" in message.lower():
        return "TechSupport"
    elif "billing" in message.lower():
        return "Billing"
    elif "urgent" in message.lower():
        return "PrioritySupport"
    return None

agent = Agent(
    name="Router",
    instructions='''
    Analyze user messages and route to appropriate specialists.
    Use the should_handoff function to determine routing.
    ''',
    tools=[should_handoff, handoff]
)
```
