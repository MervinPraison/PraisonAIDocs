# Workflows CLI Commands

The `praisonai-ts` CLI provides the `workflow` command for executing multi-agent workflows.

## Execute Workflow

```bash
# Execute a workflow from YAML file
praisonai-ts workflow workflow.yaml

# Execute with parallel processing
praisonai-ts workflow workflow.yaml --parallel

# Get JSON output
praisonai-ts workflow workflow.yaml --json
```

## Workflow YAML Format

```yaml
# workflow.yaml
name: Research Workflow
agents:
  - name: Researcher
    instructions: Research the topic
  - name: Writer
    instructions: Write a summary

steps:
  - agent: Researcher
    task: Research AI trends
  - agent: Writer
    task: Summarize findings
```

## SDK Usage

For programmatic workflow execution:

```typescript
import { Workflow, WorkflowManager } from 'praisonai';

const workflow = new Workflow({
  name: 'My Workflow',
  agents: [researcher, writer],
  steps: [
    { agent: 'Researcher', task: 'Research topic' },
    { agent: 'Writer', task: 'Write summary' }
  ]
});

const manager = new WorkflowManager();
const result = await manager.execute(workflow);
```
