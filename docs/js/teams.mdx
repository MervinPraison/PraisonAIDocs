Agents can work together as a team to solve complex problems.

## Quick Start

<Steps>

<Step title="Create a Team">
```typescript
import { Agent, Team } from 'praisonai';

const researcher = new Agent({
  name: 'Researcher',
  instructions: 'You research topics thoroughly'
});

const writer = new Agent({
  name: 'Writer',
  instructions: 'You write clear, engaging content'
});

const team = new Team({
  agents: [researcher, writer],
  process: 'sequential'
});

await team.start('Write an article about AI');
// Researcher gathers info → Writer creates article
```
</Step>

<Step title="With Manager">
```typescript
const team = new Team({
  agents: [researcher, writer],
  process: 'hierarchical',
  manager: new Agent({ instructions: 'You coordinate the team' })
});
```
</Step>

</Steps>

## User Interaction Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Team
    participant R as Researcher
    participant W as Writer
    
    User->>Team: "Write article about AI"
    Team->>R: Research AI
    R-->>Team: Research findings
    Team->>W: Write using research
    W-->>Team: Draft article
    Team-->>User: Final article
```

---

## Configuration Levels

```typescript
// Level 1: Array - Simple team
const team = new Team({
  agents: [researcher, writer]
});

// Level 2: String - Named process
const team = new Team({
  agents: [researcher, writer],
  process: 'sequential'  // or 'parallel', 'hierarchical'
});

// Level 3: Dict - Full configuration
const team = new Team({
  agents: [researcher, writer],
  process: 'hierarchical',
  manager: managerAgent,
  maxRounds: 5,
  verbose: true
});
```

## Team Processes

| Process | How It Works |
|---------|--------------|
| `sequential` | Agents work one after another |
| `parallel` | Agents work at the same time |
| `hierarchical` | Manager coordinates agents |

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Give each agent one role">
    Specialized agents produce better results than generalists.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use sequential for dependencies">
    When one agent needs another's output, use sequential process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use hierarchical for complex tasks">
    A manager helps coordinate when tasks require judgment calls.
