## Choosing a Workflow Pattern

| Pattern | Use Case | Pros | Cons |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **Routing** | Tasks need different specialists | Efficient, specialized | Requires good routing logic |
| **Parallel** | Independent subtasks | Fast, scalable | No inter-task communication |
| **Sequential** | Step-by-step processes | Simple, predictable | Slower, sequential bottleneck |
| **Orchestrator** | Complex, dynamic tasks | Flexible, adaptive | More complex, higher token usage |
