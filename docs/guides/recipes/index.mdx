## What Are Recipes?

Recipes are pre-packaged, reusable AI workflows that encapsulate:
- Agent configurations
- Tool assignments
- Workflow logic
- Input/output schemas
- Security policies

## Key Benefits

- **Reusability**: Package once, deploy anywhere
- **Consistency**: Same behavior across environments
- **Security**: Built-in policy enforcement
- **Observability**: Structured logging and tracing
- **Versioning**: Track and rollback changes

## Getting Started

```bash
# List available recipes
praisonai recipe list

# Run a recipe
praisonai recipe run my-recipe --input '{"query": "Hello"}'

# Start the recipe server
praisonai recipe serve --port 8765
```

## Next Steps

1. Review the [Integration Models](/docs/guides/recipes/integration-models) to choose your approach
2. Explore [Use Cases](/docs/guides/recipes/use-cases) for implementation patterns
3. Follow the step-by-step tutorials for your chosen model
