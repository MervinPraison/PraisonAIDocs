The @mentions feature allows you to include external content in your prompts, similar to Cursor IDE's mention system.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Include a file
praisonai "@file:main.py explain this code"

# Include a doc
praisonai "@doc:project-overview help me understand this project"

# Search the web
praisonai "@web:python best practices give me tips"
```

## Supported Mentions

| Mention | Syntax | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| File | `@file:path/to/file.py` | Include file content |
| Doc | `@doc:doc-name` | Include doc from `.praison/docs/` |
| Web | `@web:search query` | Search the web |
| URL | `@url:https://...` | Fetch URL content |
| Rule | `@rule:rule-name` | Include specific rule |

## File Mention

Include file content in your prompt:

```bash
praisonai "@file:src/main.py explain this code"
```

**What happens:**
1. The file content is read
2. Content is wrapped in a code block with language detection
3. Content is prepended to your prompt

**Example with multiple files:**
```bash
praisonai "@file:src/main.py @file:src/utils.py how do these files work together?"
```

### Relative and Absolute Paths

```bash
# Relative path (from current directory)
praisonai "@file:src/main.py explain"

# Absolute path
praisonai "@file:/Users/me/project/main.py explain"
```

## Doc Mention

Include documentation from `.praison/docs/`:

```bash
praisonai "@doc:project-overview help me add a new feature"
```

**Prerequisites:**
- Create docs using `praisonai docs create`
- Or add markdown files to `.praison/docs/`

**Example:**
```bash
# First create a doc
praisonai docs create coding-standards "Use type hints. Follow PEP 8."

# Then reference it
praisonai "@doc:coding-standards review my code"
```

## Web Mention

Search the web and include results:

```bash
praisonai "@web:python asyncio tutorial explain async/await"
```

**What happens:**
1. Web search is performed using DuckDuckGo
2. Top 3 results are included
3. Results are prepended to your prompt

<Note>
Requires `duckduckgo-search` package: `pip install duckduckgo-search`
</Note>

## URL Mention

Fetch and include content from a URL:

```bash
praisonai "@url:https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html summarize this"
```

**What happens:**
1. URL content is fetched
2. HTML is converted to text
3. Content is truncated if too long (max 10KB)

## Rule Mention

Include a specific rule from `.praison/rules/`:

```bash
praisonai "@rule:python-style apply these rules to my code"
```

## Multiple Mentions

Combine multiple mentions in a single prompt:

```bash
praisonai "@file:main.py @doc:coding-standards @web:python best practices review and improve this code"
```

**Processing order:**
1. All mentions are extracted
2. Content is fetched for each mention
3. All content is prepended to the cleaned prompt
4. Agent processes the combined context

## Context Format

When mentions are processed, the context is formatted as:

```markdown
# File: main.py
```python
def hello():
    print("Hello, World!")
```

# Doc: coding-standards
Use type hints for all functions.
Follow PEP 8 style guide.

# Web Search: python best practices
1. "Python Best Practices" - realpython.com
   ...

# Task:
review and improve this code
```

## Python API

```python
from praisonaiagents.tools.mentions import MentionsParser, process_mentions

# Initialize parser
parser = MentionsParser(workspace_path=".")

# Check if prompt has mentions
has_mentions = parser.has_mentions("@file:main.py explain")
print(has_mentions)  # True

# Extract mentions without processing
mentions = parser.extract_mentions("@file:main.py @doc:readme explain")
print(mentions)  # {'file': ['main.py'], 'doc': ['readme']}

# Process mentions and get context
context, cleaned_prompt = parser.process("@file:main.py explain this")
print(context)  # File content
print(cleaned_prompt)  # "explain this"

# Convenience function
context, prompt = process_mentions("@file:main.py explain")
```

## Use Cases

### Code Review

```bash
praisonai "@file:src/auth.py @doc:security-guidelines review this code for security issues"
```

### Documentation

```bash
praisonai "@file:src/api.py generate API documentation for this file"
```

### Learning

```bash
praisonai "@url:https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html explain async/await"
```

### Research

```bash
praisonai "@web:machine learning trends 2024 summarize the latest developments"
```

### Refactoring

```bash
praisonai "@file:old_code.py @doc:coding-standards refactor this code to follow our standards"
```

## Limitations

| Limitation | Details |
|------------|---------|
| File size | Max 50KB per file |
| URL content | Max 10KB after HTML stripping |
| Web search | Top 3 results only |
| Nested mentions | Not supported |

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Be Specific" icon="bullseye">
    Use specific file paths rather than directories
  </Card>
  <Card title="Combine Wisely" icon="layer-group">
    Don't overload with too many mentions - context has limits
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create Docs" icon="file-lines">
    Create reusable docs for frequently needed context

  <Card title="Use Rules" icon="gavel">
    Reference rules for consistent coding standards

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| File not found | Check the file path is correct and file exists |
| Doc not found | Create the doc with `praisonai docs create` |
| Web search failed | Install `duckduckgo-search` package |
| URL fetch failed | Check URL is accessible and valid |
