</Step>

<Step title="Create Your Agent File">
Create a new file called `my_agent.py`:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

# Create your first agent
agent = Agent(
    name="ResearchAssistant",
    instructions="You are a helpful research assistant. Explain things simply and clearly."
)

# Ask it a question
agent.start("Explain how solar panels work in simple terms")
