## Quick Start

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

# Research agent with web search
researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="Research topics and provide clear summaries",
    web=True  # Enable web search
)

researcher.start("What are the latest trends in AI?")
```

<Note>
Enable `web=True` to give your agent web search capabilities.
</Note>

## Complete Example

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

# Create a research agent
researcher = Agent(
    name="ResearchAgent",
    instructions="""You are a research specialist.

When researching:
- Search for accurate, current information
- Organize findings clearly
- Identify key facts and insights
- Present in a structured format""",
    web=True
)

# Research a topic
researcher.start("Research the impact of renewable energy on carbon emissions")
```

---

## Structured Research Output

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

researcher = Agent(
    name="StructuredResearcher",
    instructions="""You research topics and provide structured reports.

Format your response as:
## Summary
Brief overview

## Key Facts
- Fact 1
- Fact 2
- Fact 3

## Analysis
Deeper insights

## Sources
List of sources""",
    web=True
)

researcher.start("Research quantum computing advancements")
```

## Research Team

Multiple agents working together for deep research:

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, Agents

# Researcher finds information
researcher = Agent(
    name="Researcher",
    instructions="Find comprehensive information on topics",
    web=True
)

# Analyst interprets findings
analyst = Agent(
    name="Analyst",
    instructions="Analyze research and identify key insights"
)

# Writer creates the report
writer = Agent(
    name="Writer",
    instructions="Write clear, structured research reports"
)

# Create research team
team = AgentManager(
    agents=[researcher, analyst, writer],
    process="sequential"
)

team.start("Research the future of electric vehicles")
```
