## Quick Start

```python

# Data analysis agent
analyst = Agent(
    name="DataAnalyst",
    instructions="Analyze data and provide clear insights with recommendations"
)

# Analyze sales data
analyst.start("""

def calculate_stats(numbers: str) -> str:
    """Calculate statistics from comma-separated numbers"""
    data = [float(x.strip()) for x in numbers.split(',')]
    return f"""
    Count: {len(data)}
    Sum: {sum(data)}
    Average: {sum(data)/len(data):.2f}
    Min: {min(data)}
    Max: {max(data)}
    """

analyst = Agent(
    name="DataAnalyst",
    instructions="Analyze data using available tools",
    tools=[calculate_stats]
)

analyst.start("Calculate stats for: 12500, 13200, 15800, 14300, 16700, 18900")
```

## Multi-Agent Analysis

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent, AgentTeam

# Data processor
processor = Agent(
    name="DataProcessor",
    instructions="Clean and organize data for analysis"
)

# Analyst
analyst = Agent(
    name="Analyst",
    instructions="Analyze data and find patterns"
)

# Reporter
reporter = Agent(
    name="Reporter",
    instructions="Create clear reports from analysis"
)

team = AgentTeam(
    agents=[processor, analyst, reporter],
    process="sequential"
)

team.start("Analyze quarterly sales performance")
```

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Provide Context">
    Tell the agent what the data represents
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Ask Specific Questions">
    "What's the trend?" is better than "Analyze this"
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Request Structure">
    Ask for organized output with sections
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Include Comparisons">
    Provide benchmarks or previous periods
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
