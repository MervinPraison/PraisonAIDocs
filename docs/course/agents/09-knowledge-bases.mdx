Knowledge gives agents access to your documents, PDFs, and data - so they can answer questions about YOUR content.

```mermaid

    subgraph "Knowledge Flow"
        Docs[📄 Your Documents] --> KB[💾 Knowledge Base]
        KB --> Agent[🤖 Agent]
        Question[❓ Question] --> Agent
        Agent --> Answer[✅ Answer from docs]
    end

## Quick Start

```python
from praisonaiagents import Agent

# Agent with knowledge from a PDF
agent = Agent(
    instructions="Answer questions from the document",
    knowledge=["company-handbook.pdf"]
)

agent.start("What is our vacation policy?")
```

<Note>
Just add `knowledge=["your-file.pdf"]` to give agents access to your documents.
