# Ollama Handling in LLM.py

The `ollama_handled` flag is used in `llm.py` (not in `agent.py`) to track whether special Ollama model handling has been applied for tool results. Here's what I found:

## Where it's used in llm.py:
- **Line 863**: `ollama_handled = False` - initialized at the beginning of the tool execution loop
- **Line 864**: Special handling logic via `_handle_ollama_model()` method
- **Line 907**: `ollama_handled = True` - set when Ollama special handling is applied
- **Line 928 & 959**: Checks `if not ollama_handled` to avoid duplicate processing

## Why it's needed:
The flag prevents duplicate processing when Ollama models require special handling. Some Ollama models return only the tool call JSON without processing the results, requiring a follow-up prompt to get the final answer. The `ollama_handled` flag ensures this special handling happens only once.

## Does this contradict the requirement?
**No, it doesn't.** The issue states:

> "ollama/xxxx model is already handled via llm.py via litellm, so no special condition or handling required for ollama inside agent.py"

âœ… **Current implementation is correct:**

- `agent.py` has NO ollama-specific conditions (only one documentation mention as an example)
- All ollama handling is contained within `llm.py` as intended
- The `ollama_handled` flag is an internal implementation detail within `llm.py`

The codebase already follows the desired pattern where ollama models are handled through the generic LLM interface via litellm without special conditions in agent.py.
